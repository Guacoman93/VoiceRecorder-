Chismeando

This project is a simple application that will record a 10-second (You can edit the time of record) audio clip at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz, amplify the audio by a factor of 3.0, and save it as a WAV file with the current date and time in its name.

Objective

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how to record and process audio using Python and the sounddevice and scipy.io.wavfile libraries.

Requirements

To run this code, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

sounddevice: to record audio
scipy.io.wavfile: to write audio to a WAV file
numpy: to process numerical data arrays
datetime: to get the current date and time
Execution
To run this code, simply execute the script and follow the on-screen instructions. The recording will begin and will stop when it is ready. The recorded file will be saved in the same directory as the script with a name that includes the current date and time.
